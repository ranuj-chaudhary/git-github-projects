LEARNINGS

1) How to create GITFLOW for your project?

--> Initialise Git flow

INIT COMMAND GIT FLOW
 git flow init

SETUP DEVELOP UPSTREAM BRANCH TO REMOTE
git push --set-upstream origin develop

NOte: The above command is used to push a local branch to a remote repository
 for the first time and to set up tracking so that future pushes can be done more simply
with just git push.


CREATE FEATURE BRANCH
git flow feature start feature1.0

Create New feature file , add amd commit

FINISH FEATURE BRANCH
git flow feature finish feature1.0

Note:
a) Now we will switch to develop branch and file of feature will
merge with develop branch.
b) Feature branch will be deleted automatically.


CREATE RELEASE BRANCH
git flow release start release1.0

Create New feature file , add amd commit


SETUP REALEASE BRANCH UPSTREAM TO REMOTE

git push --set-upstream origin release/release1.0

FINISH RELEASE BRANCH
git flow release finish release1.0


2) How to HOTFIX in your existing respository?
Note: used to fix bug and push bug fixes to both main and develop branch.

CREATE HOTFIX BRANCH
git flow hotfix start hotfix1.0

Create New fix or bug file , add and commit

FINISH HOTFIX BRANCH
git flow hotfix finish hotfix1.0
